Today the paper for our group's tool [Aldy](https://github.com/inumanag/aldy) was published in [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03273-1) ([doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03273-1](http://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03273-1)).
Really excited about this tool, it has a solid algorithmic approach and my role helping out with data analysis and debugging led to my position as third author. It is also the inspiration for my thesis work which is ongoing.
