Hey there, I'm Mike. I'm a Computational Biologist and Data Scientist who builds [tools for genomics research](github.com/michael-ford). I'm current employed by Indiana University, Bloomignton as a research contractor, and I primarily work with [Cenk Sahinalp](https://ccr.cancer.gov/cancer-data-science-laboratory/s-cenk-sahinalp) and the [Cancer Data Science Lab](https://ccr.cancer.gov/cancer-data-science-laboratory) at the National Cancer Institute, NIH.

I am the creator of the [ImmunoTyper](https://github.com/michael-ford/ImmunoTyper) tool ([paper here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004220300675)) for Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain V gene genotyping using WGS [PacBio](https://www.pacb.com/) sequence. I am also co-author to the paper describing the [Aldy tool](https://github.com/0xTCG/aldy) for pharmacogenomic genotyping, published in [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03273-1).
